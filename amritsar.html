            Amritsar, colloquially known as Ambarsar and historically known as Ramdaspur is located in the Punjab state of India. It derives its name from Amrit Sarovar which was built by Guru Ram Das in the village of Tung. Guru Ram Das believed that the waters of the lake had healing powers. The land was bought by him for a small amount of 700 rupees and a temple complex was built around it. Gradually, the village developed and came to be known as Chakk Ram Das which finally became Amritsar that literally translates to pool of nectar.
