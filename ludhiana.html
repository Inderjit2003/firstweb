             Ludhiana city was founded in the time of Lodhi dynasty which ruled in Delhi from 1451-1526 A.D. The legend goes that two Lodhi Chief Yusaf Khan and Nihand Khan were deputed by Sikandar Lodhi (1489-1517 A.D.) to restore order in this region. They camped at the site of present city of Ludhiana which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusaf Khan went across the river Sutlej in Jalandhar Doab to check Khokhars who were plundering the Doab and made a settlement at Sultanpur while Nihand Khan stayed back and founded the present city at the site of village Mir Hota. The new town was originally known as Lodhi-ana, which means the town of Lodhi’s. The name later changed to the present name Ludhiana.Ludhiana is now a District Headquarter with Parliamentary Constituency of the same name. It is one of the biggest Municipal Corporations of the State.
             It is spread over about 310 km2. The city stands on the Sutlej’s old bank, 13 km south of its present course. Over the years, the city has turned out to be a vibrant kaleidoscope of different cultures and activities. The city has developed a variety of traits and qualities which are perceptible in various forms.
